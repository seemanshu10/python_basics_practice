# fractional exponents

x= 16 
y= 1.5

#using exponential operator 
print (x**y)

# negative base 
# negatives in exponets doesn't matter in exponents 
a=-3
b=2

print (a**b)

# exponets with negative exponent 
# output is 0.25 as negatice takes reciprocal 1/2^2
a=2
print (a**-2)

# exponents with larger numbers 
a=10
b=10

print (a**b)

# floor division 
a =10 
b=3
print (a//b)

a =10.6 
b=3.5
print (a//b)

# modulus %

a,b= 10,3
print (a%b)
